# advicebot
A bot which tweets out advice randomly selected from a list of tips

It reads in a list of tips, and every hour (or day, or whatever) tweets one at random. 

To set it up for yourself, you only need to change the API keys to match your app account and change the list of tips to be things which you have written yourself. The example list here features advice for computer science freshers.
